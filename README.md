# Neo-C: The new C programming language
## The C programming language, a Safe and Modern Implementation

The language will be implemented in C, consisting of a compiler frontend to compile source language to LLVM Intermediate Representation. \
\
Inspired by the following languages - C, Rust and Python. \
To know more about LLVM compiler framework - https://llvm.org/

## Key Features
* Clean, Readable and Consistent Syntax rules and conventions
* Ownership/Borrowing based manual memory management model
* Support for Generic / Polymorphic code
* Modern fixed-length type system, references
* Type conversions must be Explicit
* Extended struct capabilities
* Memory-safe, type-safe, thread-safe, null-safe by Design
* Improved inline (assembly, llvm ir) syntax, do not optimize - no_opt flag
