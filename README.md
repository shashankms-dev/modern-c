# Neo-C: The new C programming language
## The C programming language, a Safe and Modern Implementation

The language will be implemented in C, consisting of a compiler frontend to compile source language to LLVM Intermediate Representation. \
\
Inspired by the following languages - C, Rust and Python. \
To know more about LLVM compiler framework - https://llvm.org/

## Key Features
* Clean, Readable Syntax rules and conventions
* Ownership/Borrowing based memory management model
* Generics
* Modern fixed-length type system, references
* Explicit type conversions
* Extended struct capabilities
* Improved inline (assembly, llvm ir) syntax - no_opt
